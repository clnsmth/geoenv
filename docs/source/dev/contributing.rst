We’ll review your submission and may offer suggestions. Once everything looks good—it’s in!


.. _code-style-&-linting:

Code Style & Linting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To keep the codebase consistent 🧹, we use:

- `Black`_ for automatic formatting
- `Pylint`_ for static code analysis

Run both with:

::

    poetry run black src/ tests/
    poetry run pylint src/ tests/



.. _improving-the-documentation:

Improving the Documentation
---------------------------

We love doc updates! 📘

The docs live in the ``docs/`` directory and use `Sphinx`_ + `reStructuredText`_.

To build them locally:

::

    poetry run make --directory=docs clean html

API docs are generated from `PEP 287`_-style docstrings.

.. _writing-good-commit-messages:

Writing Good Commit Messages
----------------------------

We value small, focused commits and transparent development practices. ✍🏽

A good commit message explains *what* changed and *why*.

We recommend:

- Limit the **header** to 52 characters or less.
- Wrap the **body** at 72 characters.
- Follow the `Angular style`_ format.

Example:

::

    feat: add new feature to improve performance

    This feature optimizes the algorithm for better speed.
    It reduces the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n log n).

    Closes #123
