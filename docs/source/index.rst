`geoenv` is a Python library that links geographic locations‚Äîlike points and polygons‚Äîto environmental descriptions using global datasets and semantic vocabularies.

It‚Äôs like reverse geocoding, but for environments.

Whether you're working with field samples, sensor deployments, or satellite observations, `geoenv` helps you describe the environment with consistent, interoperable metadata.

.. _Environment Ontology: https://sites.google.com/site/environmentontology/

Highlights
----------

- üåç **Global data support**
  Works with terrestrial and ecological datasets at global scale.

- üß† **Semantically rich**
  Maps environmental terms to `ENVO <https://sites.google.com/site/environmentontology/>`_ and other vocabularies.

- üîå **Extensible**
  Plug in your own data sources or vocabularies.

- üß∞ **Built for integration**
  Returns structured GeoJSON + Schema.org outputs for interoperability.

.. _quickstart:

‚ö° Quick Start
-------------

Install directly from GitHub:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install git+https://github.com/clnsmth/geoenv.git@main

Resolve a point on land:

.. code-block:: python

   from geoenv.data_sources import WorldTerrestrialEcosystems
   from geoenv.resolver import Resolver
   from geoenv.geometry import Geometry

   # Define a geometry in GeoJSON format
   geometry = Geometry(
       {
           "type": "Point",
           "coordinates": [
               -122.622364,
               37.905931
           ]
       }
   )

   # Configure the resolver with one or more data sources
   resolver = Resolver(data_source=[WorldTerrestrialEcosystems()])

   # Resolve the geometry to environmental descriptions
   response = resolver.get_environment(geometry)

The result is a GeoJSON Feature with structured environments mapped to ENVO (by default):

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "type": "Feature",
     "identifier": null,
     "geometry": {
       "type": "Point",
       "coordinates": [
         -122.622364,
         37.905931
       ]
     },
     "properties": {
       "description": null,
       "environment": [
         {
           "type": "Environment",
           "dataSource": {
             "identifier": "https://doi.org/10.5066/P9DO61LP",
             "name": "WorldTerrestrialEcosystems"
           },
           "dateCreated": "2025-03-07 15:53:09",
           "properties": {
             "temperature": "Warm Temperate",
             "moisture": "Moist",
             "landCover": "Cropland",
             "landForm": "Mountains",
             "climate": "Warm Temperate Moist",
             "ecosystem": "Warm Temperate Moist Cropland on Mountains"
           },
           "mappedProperties": [
             {
               "label": "temperate",
               "uri": "http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000206"
             },
             {
               "label": "humid air",
               "uri": "http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000828"
             },
             {
               "label": "area of cropland",
               "uri": "http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000892"
             },
             {
               "label": "mountain range",
               "uri": "http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00000080"
             }
           ]
         }
       ]
     }
   }

But how do I link results back to my data?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

That's what the resolver's ``identifier`` and ``description`` parameters are for. Set these to whatever values are useful for your application.

.. code-block:: python

   response = resolver.get_environment(
       geometry = geometry,
       identifier="5b4edec5-ea5e-471a-8a3c-2c1171d59dee",
       description="Point on land",
   )

These will then be displayed in the GeoJSON response and accessible whenever you need it.

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "type": "Feature",
     "identifier": "5b4edec5-ea5e-471a-8a3c-2c1171d59dee",
     "geometry": {... same as before},
     "properties": {
       "description": "Point on land",
       "environment": [... same as before]
     }
   }

Can I resolve against multiple data sources?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

But we don't always know where a geometry will resolve to. That's OK. We can configure the resolver with a list of data sources to query and it will try them all.

.. code-block:: python

   from geoenv.resolver import Resolver
   from geoenv.data_sources import (WorldTerrestrialEcosystems,
                                    EcologicalCoastalUnits,
                                    EcologicalMarineUnits)

   # Now configured with 3 data sources
   resolver = Resolver(
       data_source=[
           WorldTerrestrialEcosystems(),
           EcologicalCoastalUnits(),
           EcologicalMarineUnits()
       ]
   )

   response = resolver.get_environment(geometry)

The response is a list of environments listing each data source.

.. code-block:: json

   response

Support for Schema.org?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We may want to represent this in Schema.org format. The response is already structured to be easily converted to Schema.org.

.. code-block:: python

   response.to_schema_org()

Presto

.. code-block:: json

   schema.org example

üìö Motivation
-------------

There is a vast amount of data available from diverse sources, and `geoenv` offers a straightforward way to expose the environmental semantics of these datasets. By doing so, it provides a mechanism to connect otherwise disparate data sources through a shared environmental context, unlocking new opportunities for integrated analysis and research.
